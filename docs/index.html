<p>
  This website introduces you to my two Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Tubby and Nuggets.
</p>

<p>
  Tubby currently lives with me in Chicago, while Nuggets remains in Singapore.  Both are incredibly
  sweet dogs, but unfortunately they do not get along.
</p>
<p>
  This website will first give a quick introduction to corgis before
  presenting Tubby and Nuggets to the internet.

    Corgis are easily recognizable because of their stumpy legs and stout bodies.
  <p>
    Although they are most famous for being Queen Elizabeth II's favourite dog
    (she owned some 30 of them over time!), corgis were originally bred to be herding dogs.
    Their short stature made them ideal for this job, as they would be able to avoid larger animals
    trying to kick them away.
    </p>

  <p>
    Corgis also make awesome pets!  They are very intelligent and trainable dogs, and
    generally love being around people.  However, be warned, they shed.  <em> A. Lot. </em>

    Tubby was adopted in June 2011 when he was 2 years old.  He's a dog with a personality -
    knows exactly what he doesn't like, and shows it too!  He has incredible patience,
    and is often found sitting by the cabinet where his toys are kept, hoping that
    someone would take them out and play with him.

    Nuggets joined the family in September 2010.  She gets along fantastically with
    children and dogs alike, and is easily the most popular dog in the neighbour.
    Nuggets is always ready for a walk, and even more excited when she
    knows she's getting a car ride.
